Gulapa & Baclay LLP is the New York affiliate of Gulapa Law, a law firm based in the Philippines. Just a year after its establishment in September 2015, Gulapa Law Office has already been recognized as one of the Philippine leading law firms, having won Boutique Law Firm of the Year at the 2016 Asian Legal Business Philippine Law Awards.

At present, Gulapa Law Office is already assisting several US companies in their investments in the Philippines and business collaborations in the ASEAN region. Gulapa Law Office decided to set up an affiliate in New York City after it was asked by some of its Philippine-based clients to assist them in their US-related matters.

Gulapa Law Office hopes that Gulapa & Baclay LLP would serve as a platform to promote the Philippines as an investment hub and also a gateway to the ASEAN economic region.
